# hello-world
My first repository, hello world!

I'm @noodledude. My start to computers and "programming" was video games and modding them, but always as a user copy/pasting scripts and not as the actual developer!
Right now I am working hard learning AWS Cloud Formation and CDK for my job. 

Thank you for reading as I learn to utilize GitHub!
